        <H4>WINING TEAM CAPTION INFORMATION</H4>
        <dt><b>Hardik pandya (captain) </b></dt>
        <dd>A big hitter and a fast-bowling all-rounder, Hardik ticks all the boxes that a team desires from an
            all-rounder. It was no surprise that he was fast-tracked into the Indian ODI and T20 side after a successful
            run in the IPL 2015. In his debut IPL game against RCB, he hit a six off just the second ball he faced.</dd>
        <dt><b>Rashid khan (vice captain)</b></dt>
        <dd>Arguably the best leg-spinner in white ball cricket, Rashid Khan was drafted in the Gujarat Titans squad for
            INR 15 crore ahead of the IPL 2022 Mega Auction. Afghanistan leggie, Rashid Khan’s story is nothing short of
            a tale of hard work and passion bringing deserved glory. He grew up in a war-torn Afghanistan and rose
            through the ranks by his impressive advancements first in tennis ball cricket and then at the higher levels.
            Ever since his debut IPL season in 2017, Rashid has garnered all the right eyeballs owing to his mastery
            with the ball. The leg-spinner turned in a few memorable match-winning efforts in SRH’s journey to the
            finals the 2018 edition. He took 21 wickets and emerged as the second-highest wicket taker in that edition.
            Over the years he has been one of the most sought after players in franchise T20 leagues and with a wealth
            of experience, he is definitely a threat to the opposition.</dd>
